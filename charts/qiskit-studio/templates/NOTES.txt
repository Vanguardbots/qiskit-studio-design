Qiskit Studio has been successfully installed!

IMPORTANT: The application pods may take a few minutes to start up, especially on the first installation as the knowledge base is preloaded with documentation.

You can monitor the status of all pods by running the following command:
  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }} --watch

Once all pods are in the 'Running' or 'Completed' state, you can access the Qiskit Studio frontend at the following addresses:
{{- $origin := include "qiskit-studio.frontend.origin" . -}}
{{ $urls := splitList "," $origin -}}
{{- range $url := $urls }}
  {{ $url }}
{{- end }}

LLM Configuration:
  Chat LLM URL:          {{ .Values.global.llm.chat.baseUrl }}
  Embedding LLM URL:     {{ .Values.global.llm.embedding.baseUrl }}

{{- end -}}
